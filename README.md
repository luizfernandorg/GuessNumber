# Gues Number

This is my first Android/IOS APP made using React Native as part of the course I'm enrolled in

## To download the app
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luizfernandorg/GuessNumber.git
```
Then you need to install the dependencies
```
$ cd GuessNumber 
$ npm install
```
Open your emulator for Android or IOS
```
$ npm start
```
